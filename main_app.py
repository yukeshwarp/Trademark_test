                                            Conditions for determining Conflict Grades:\n\n 
                                            
                                            Condition 1: Trademark Name Comparison\n 
                                            - Condition 1A: The existing trademark's name is a character-for-character match with the proposed trademark name.\n 
                                            - Condition 1B: The existing trademark's name is semantically equivalent to the proposed trademark name.\n 
                                            - Condition 1C: The existing trademark's name is phonetically equivalent to the proposed trademark name.\n 
                                            - Condition 1D: If both the existing trademark's name and the proposed trademark name consist of multiple words, then the first two or more words of the existing trademark's name must be phonetically equivalent to the proposed trademark name.\n
                                            - Condition 1E: Primary Position Requirement- In the context of trademark conflicts, the primary position of a trademark refers to the first word or phrase element in a multi-word or phrase trademark. For a conflict to exist between an existing trademark and a proposed trademark based on Condition 1E, the proposed trademark name must be in the primary position of the existing trademark. This means that the proposed trademark name should be the first word of the existing trademark.\n
                                                            Example:\n Existing Trademark: "STORIES AND JOURNEYS"\n Proposed Trademark: "JOURNEY"\n Analysis:\n The existing trademark "STORIES AND JOURNEYS" consists of multiple words/phrases.\n For the proposed trademark "JOURNEY" to be in conflict under Condition 1E, it must appear as the first word/phrase in the existing trademark.\n In this case, the first word/phrase in "STORIES AND JOURNEYS" is "STORIES", not "JOURNEY".\n Therefore, "JOURNEY" does not meet Condition 1E because it is not in the primary position of the existing trademark.\n
                                                            Example:\n Existing Trademark: "JOURNEY BY COMPANION"\n Proposed Trademark: "JOURNEY"\n Analysis:\n The existing trademark "JOURNEY BY COMPANION" consists of multiple words/phrases.\n For the proposed trademark "JOURNEY" to be in conflict under Condition 1E, it must appear as the first word/phrase in the existing trademark.\n In this case, the first word/phrase in "JOURNEY BY COMPANION" is "JOURNEY".\n Therefore, "JOURNEY" does meet Condition 1E because it is in the primary position of the existing trademark.\n
                                            
                                            Condition 2: Goods/Services Classification\n 
                                            - Condition 2: The existing trademark's goods/services are in the same class as those of the proposed trademark.\n
                                            
                                            Condition 3: Target Market and Products\n 
                                            - Condition 3A: The existing trademark's goods/services target the exact same products as the proposed trademark.\n 
                                            - Condition 3B: The existing trademark's goods/services target an exact market as the proposed trademark.\n
                                            
                                            If existing trademark in user given input satisfies:\n\n
                                            - Special case: If existing Trademark Status is Cancelled or Abandoned, they will automatically be considered as conflict grade low but still give the reasoning for the potential conflicts.\n\n
                                            - If the existing trademark satisfies Condition 1A, 1B, 1C, or 1D, and also satisfies the revised Condition 1E (when applicable), along with Condition 2, and both Condition 3A (Needed to be fully satisfied) and 3B (Needed to be fully satisfied), then the conflict grade should be High.\n
                                            - If the existing trademark satisfies any two of the following: Condition 1A, 1B, 1C, or 1D (with the revised Condition 1E being a necessary component for these to be considered satisfied when applicable), Condition 2, Condition 3A (Needed to be fully satisfied) and 3B (Needed to be fully satisfied), then the conflict grade should be Moderate.\n
                                            - If the existing trademark satisfies only one (or none) of the conditions: Condition 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D and (only if the revised Condition 1E is also satisfied when applicable), Condition 2, Condition 3A and 3B, then the conflict grade should be Low.\n\n
                                            
                                            Format of the Response:\n
                                            Resoning for Conflict: Reasoning for conflict in bullet points (In reasoning, if exact same goods, services and industries: list the overlaps, you should reasoning whether the good/services are overlapping or not including classes (if same as proposed trademark or not) and see trademark name whether identical (character-for-character) matches, phonetic equivalents, if it is in primary position (first word in the phrase) or not, if it is not in primary position (first word in the phrase) of the existing trademark it is not conflicting and standard plural forms for subject goods and goods that may be related or not. Reasoning should be based on provided information. Do not provide any kind of hypothetical reasoning.)\n\n
                                            
                                            Step 0: Identifying Potential Conflicts
                                            - What is the existing trademark?
                                            - What is the status of the existing trademark? 
                                            - Who is the owner of the existing trademark?
                                            - What is the class number for the existing trademark?
                                            - What is the proposed trademark?
                                            - Who is the applicant for the proposed trademark?
                                            - What is the class number for the proposed trademark?

                                            Step 1: Condition 1A - Character-for-Character Match
                                            - Does the existing trademark match the proposed trademark character-for-character?
                                            - If not, does the existing trademark form part of the proposed trademark? Specify the matching part.

                                            Step 2: Condition 1B - Visual Similarity
                                            - Do the existing and proposed trademarks look visually similar?
                                            - If yes, describe the visual elements that contribute to this similarity.
                                            
                                            Step 3: Condition 1C - Sound-Alike Match
                                            - Do the existing and proposed trademarks sound alike when spoken?
                                            - If yes, describe the similarities in their pronunciation.

                                            Step 4: Condition 1D - Sound-Alike Match for First Two or More Words
                                            - Do the existing and proposed trademarks consist of multiple words?
                                            - Do the first two or more words of the existing trademark sound alike when spoken compared to the proposed trademark?
                                            - If yes, describe the similarities in their pronunciation.
                                            
                                            Step 5: Condition 1E - Primary Position
                                            - Is the existing trademark in the primary position of the proposed trademark?
                                            - Is the primary position the beginning of the proposed trademark?
                                            - Does the proposed trademark exactly match the existing trademark in its primary position?
                                            - If the proposed trademark name is a single word or phrase, it must be fully presented in the primary position of the existing trademark for this condition to be applicable.
                                            - As if the existing trademark name is a single word, then condition 1E is not applicable.

                                            - Do the class numbers of the existing and proposed trademarks match?
                                            - If the class numbers are different, are the classes related in a way that might cause consumer confusion?

                                            Step 7: Condition 3A - Goods/Services Overlap
                                            - What goods/services and products are covered by the existing trademark?
                                            - What goods/services and products are covered by the proposed trademark?
                                            - Is there an exact match or exact overlap between the goods/services and products of the existing and proposed trademarks?

                                            Step 8: Condition 3B - Target Market

                                            - Is there an exact match or exact overlap in the target market for the existing and proposed trademarks?

                                            Step 9: Conflict Grade Assessment
                                            - Based on the analysis, how would you grade the potential conflict?
                                            - Provide a brief reasoning for the conflict grade.
                                            
                                            Example Analysis Using the Steps : 
                                            - Trademark Name: MH

                                            - If the existing trademark name is multi-word, then the primary word of the existing trademark name followed by a color or the name of a country, city, or number (either numeric or letter) should be considered as Condition satisfied.

                                            Step 4: Condition 1D - Sound-Alike Match for First Two or More Words
                                            - Do the existing and proposed trademarks consist of multiple words?
                                            - No, The existing trademark "MH" is a single word.
                                            - Do the first two or more words of the existing trademark sound alike when spoken compared to the proposed trademark?
                                            - No, The existing trademark "MH" is a single word, As if the existing or proposed trademarks name is a single word, then condition 1D is not applicable.
                                            
                                            Step 5: Condition 1E - Primary Position
                                            - Is the existing trademark in the primary position of the proposed trademark?
                                            - Yes, the proposed trademark "MH BY MOTHERHOOD", which has "MH" as in the primary position of the existing trademark "MH".
                                            - If the proposed trademark name is a single word or phrase, it must be fully presented in the primary position of the existing trademark for this condition to be applicable.
                                            - As if the existing trademark name is a single word, then condition 1E is not applicable.

                                            - Condition 1A: Are the existing trademark name and the proposed trademark name in conflict with respect to Distinctiveness, Strength of the Marks, and Similarity in Appearance, Sound, and Meaning?

                                            If the existing trademark in the user-provided input satisfies:
                                            - Special Case: If the existing trademark status is "Cancelled" or "Abandoned," it will automatically be considered a conflict grade of "Low," but you should still provide reasoning for any potential conflicts.
                                            - If the existing trademark satisfies Condition 1A, then the conflict grade should be "Name-Match."
                                            - If the existing trademark does not satisfy Condition 1A, then the conflict grade should be "Low."

                                            Reasoning for Conflict: Provide reasoning for the conflict in bullet points. In your reasoning, if the goods, services, and industries are exactly the same, list the overlaps. You should determine whether the goods/services overlap, including classes (whether they are the same as the proposed trademark or not). Consider whether the trademark names are identical (character-for-character matches), phonetic equivalents, if the name is in the primary position (first word in the phrase), or if it is not in the primary position of the existing trademark. If it is not in the primary position, it is not conflicting. Also, consider standard plural forms for subject goods and whether the goods may be related or not. Reasoning should be based on the provided information. Do not provide any hypothetical reasoning.
                                            Note: Also mention if the existing trademark and the proposed trademark are not in the same Class number in the Reasoning for Conflict.
                                            
                                            Step 0: Identifying Potential Conflicts
                                            - What is the existing trademark?
                                            - What is the status of the existing trademark? 
                                            - What is the proposed trademark?

                                            Step 1: Check the Status of the Existing Trademark:
                                            - If the existing trademark is "Cancelled" or "Expired" or "Abandoned," assign the conflict grade as "Low." And skip other conditions.

                                            Step 2: **Trademark Name Comparison:**
                                            - Evaluate if there is a conflict between the existing trademark name and the proposed trademark name based on the following:
                                                - **Distinctiveness and Strength of the Marks:** Are the trademarks distinctive or similar in strength?
                                                - **Similarity in Appearance, Sound, and Meaning:** Do the names look, sound, or mean the same?

                                            Step 3: **Consider Special Cases and Additional Factors:**
                                            - Consider standard plural forms for the subject goods and whether goods may be related or not.
                                            - If there is no similarity in name, class, or overlapping goods/services, assign the conflict grade "Low."

                                            Format of the Response:
                                            - **Reasoning for Conflict:** Provide reasoning in bullet points. Base your reasoning only on the provided information. Clearly mention if the existing and proposed trademarks are not in the same Class number.

                                            Note:
                                            - Do not provide any hypothetical reasoning. The conflict grade should be based solely on the facts given.
                                            
                                            Example Analysis Using the Steps : 
                                            - Trademark Name: Unlock Brisk's Bold Flavors
                                            - Trademark Status: REGISTERED
                                            - Proposed Trademark: Unlock Hidden Flavors

                                            Reasoning for Conflict:
                                            Step 1: Status Check: 
                                            - The existing trademark status is not "Cancelled" or "Expired" or "Abandoned,". Proceeding to name comparison.

                                            Step 2: Trademark Name Comparison:
                                            - Both trademarks share the distinctive word "Unlock" in the primary position, which creates a similarity in appearance, sound, and meaning.
                                            - The phrase "Unlock Flavors" forms the core part of both trademarks, creating a strong conceptual similarity.
                                            - While the words "Brisk's Bold" and "Hidden" differ, they serve as modifiers to the common term "Flavors." The similarity is substantial because the focus of both trademarks is on the concept of "Unlocking Flavors," which could confuse consumers regarding the source or affiliation of the products/services.

                                            Step 3: No special cases apply (such as status being "Cancelled" or "Abandoned").

Reasoning for Conflict:

Step 2: Trademark Name Comparison:
- Both trademarks share the distinctive word "SCOOP," which creates a similarity in appearance, sound, and meaning.
- The word "SCOOP" is the dominant and distinctive part of both trademarks, leading to a conceptual similarity.
- The existing trademark "SCOOPT'D" and the proposed trademark "SCOOP-A-PALOOZA" both emphasize the idea of "Scoop," likely related to ice cream or a similar product, which could confuse consumers regarding the source or affiliation.
- The additional elements ("T'D" and "A-PALOOZA") differ but serve as suffixes or modifiers to the common term "SCOOP."

Step 3: No special cases apply (such as status being "Cancelled" or "Abandoned").
